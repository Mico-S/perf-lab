# perf-lab
This lab involved optimizing memory intensive code in an image
filter function. To see the code that I optimized, checkout the
ChangesMade.txt and the code in applyFilter() in FilterMain.cpp. I was 
successfully able to increase the performance of the image filter function
by a factor of approximately 63.
